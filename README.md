# Color in the Complete Paintings of Vincent van Gogh: <br> A data science approach
A research project (supervised by Dr. Antonio Linero) for UT-Austin's Scientific Computation and Data Sciences Certificate.

## Abstract

Color in the Complete Paintings of Vincent van Gogh: A data science approach analyzes color features in 782 .jpg images of Vincent van Gogh’s complete paintings from a data science approach. The project aims to explore color-related changes in Van Gogh’s artistic style over time, across location-based artistic periods, and caused by the ear mutilation event. The color features are RGB dominant color, saturation, brightness, yellowness, and color diversity. The location-based artistic periods are Earliest Paintings (1881-83), Nuenen/Antwerp (1883-86), Paris (1886-88), Arles (1888-89), Saint-Remy (1889-90), and Auvers-sur-Oise (1890). The methodology involves a Python program that outputs color feature calculations for each painting image and an R report that creates visualizations from the output of the Python program. Results are 9 data visualizations; with the exception of RGB dominance, all color features have 2 corresponding data visualizations—a side-by-side boxplot and a scatterplot enhanced with smooth curves and ANOVA testing. RGB dominance has a side-by-side bar chart as its 1 data visualization.

Initial predictions are as follows: Van Gogh’s paintings are more blue-dominant near career end; saturation reaches its global maximum in Paris (1886-88); brightness reaches its global maximum in Nuenen/Antwerp (1883-86); yellowness is higher in the works from the last years; color diversity stays about the same throughout the career; discontinuity corresponding to ear mutilation occur for all color features. After ranking percentages, medians, interquartile ranges, and p-values from the data visualizations, it is concluded that initial predictions are partially correct. Van Gogh’s works are bluer near his end; saturation increases, but does not experience a maximum during Paris (1886-88); brightness reaches a local maximum in Nuenen/Antwerp (1883-86); paintings are yellower in the later years of Van Gogh’s career; color diversity does not meaningfully fluctuate; and, at a significance level of 0.05, only brightness and yellowness experience a statistically significant discontinuity corresponding to ear mutilation.
